I was reading about John von Neumann and had the idea that perhaps his 'Game theory' could be how our brains work on the subconscious level; and that his intelligence is attributed to him interpreting his brain signals faster than normal. Essentially his subconscious lets him know why he made a certain choice without him needing any introspection. I'm curious if this faster interpreting could be attributed to time perception. Like the eyes interpret the visual world and the ears the auditory one, our brain interprets time.

I would research this by asking teachers of different subjects to leave a paper on the front desk during exams. This paper would ask the student to guess how much time he just spent doing the test, without watches or clocks, and the teacher would add the actual time beside it. I would compare the exam results with their accuracy of time perception. <u>...read more</u>

To look out for;
Different classes of intelligence (mathematical, verbal, etc)
External time indicators (janitor passing at a certain time, garbage trucks, etc)
Not sure if asking students not to bring watches would be odd, making them more alert. Would need two groups?
Different approach than paper at front, maybe ask once outside? Others might start to question what the paper is and losing focus.

To look into...
