Instead, I stare idiotically at a page and forget my surrounding. Reality doesn't seem very real when you constantly dip in and out of it. Every time I come back I feel judged, as if everyone is onto me and realized I haven't turned a page in the last 5 minutes. Depression and social anxiety, the paradoxical couple; hating yourself enough to feel worthless, yet constantly thinking people would bother to judge you.</p>

My previous partner and I lived in this giant mansion in my head, it took up all the space; and despite how comfortable it was, we had to move out once we realized how toxic we were to each other. The place was a disaster. I've since had to demolish it to a single room, to something more manageable. I tell myself I'll clean it up soon, but honestly, I don't even know where I left the key, maybe she took it out of spite. It's depressing knowing you can't do it alone, yet you can't let anyone see the mess inside either.</p>

<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;" align="justify">I used to hate time, waiting for every second to go faster. End school. End this uncomfortable dinner. I'm grateful it got me through a toxic household and high-school. I mean, my life's still shit, but it's by my own doing now - and that's oddly empowering.</p>

<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;" align="justify">I sit down and put up my best spider-man impression, reaching under my chin to pull the mask off. It's not a pretty sight, skin being torn apart. The sun abandoned me, leaving me in the cold for the mask to freeze on my face. I endure the pain and pull just enough to finally breathe. And more importantly, to express myself honestly to someone whose job is to find a solution to my misery; so that I stop visiting him, letting him pursue what he really wanted from this field, to conduct research.</p>

<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;" align="justify">I've always thought I didn't have an addictive personality, being able to drop anything - cold turkey. I realize I&rsquo;m actually addicted to short term rewards. Having spent an unhealthy amount of time on a computer since I was 8; I've developed this habit of constantly multi-tasking on multiple screens, and I believe that's where it all started. Video games are experts at giving you those short-term rewards, they need to keep you hooked after all. Every skill or hobby has this limbo where you have to persevere without this dangling carrot in your face, instead you&rsquo;ll get a bigger and juicier one years down the line. I don&rsquo;t see it and I definitely don't like carrots enough to wait that long. I've never achieved anything meaningful and I have to rewrite the way my brain functioned these last 14 years to do so. It's painful. The depression shifted from '"I'm useless and will never amount to anything" to '"I have potential, but I'll never amount to anything". That's progress right?</p>

<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;" align="justify">You should see life as one big shitty game. When I still played games, I was more invested into my character's life than my own. Stop being this generic npc with a set route and some occasionally interesting dialog that keeps travelers interested for an hour or so. Be the main character that's pursuing an unrealistic goal in a world he's never set foot in. It will get tiring after a while, you're allowed to take breaks. Occupy yourself with side quests, mini-games, skills. Level up and gather supplies to defeat that boss you've died countless times to; and you won't succeed this time either, has a mechanic that needs more than one player to overcome. That's right, you're going to have to ask for help. Join a guild, work towards a common goal. It'll be hard to maintain hope with people flying above you with sick mounts while you're on the stairs taking it one step at a time, but remember the endgame is what you choose it to be, and everyone gets there eventually.</p>

<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;" align="justify">After imagining myself saying all of that out loud, I take my new anti-depressant prescription and head back to day-dreaming on the subway. Don't know why you were so hesitant to take pills before, not wanting to be dependent of them. You don't have to be. They're just training wheels to keep you up while you learn to bike on your own, and there's no shame in that either; nobody taught you, and you're capable enough not to depend on them.</p>

<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;" align="justify">Back to the real world, I think. I hear him again, knocking on his coffin. I try to ignore it, but he's just as stubborn as me - the knocks turn to punches. He thinks he's Uma Thurman, but rather than getting out he wants to pull me in with him. You feel his anger and realize the reason behind you constantly going back and forth between seeing light and darkness, forgetting if your mask is on or not, is because you&rsquo;re one and the same.</p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type: empty; -qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;" align="justify">I&rsquo;m not dragging you in, I&rsquo;m reaching out expecting you to pull me. Let me join you, meld into your skin.</p>

<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;" align="justify">Sometimes I have to stop his pretentious optimism, when he smiles for too long he starts to crack like porcelain. His naivet&eacute; bothers me, his constant positivity bothers me - but I can't take him off, and I can't let him break. It would destroy my progress and leave nothing but scars. He needs to save me from drowning, while I simultaneously hold him from floating away - staying grounded to reality. I'll let him blabber and crack every once in a while; he's only trying to help, and eventually you start believing him.</p>

<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;" align="justify">It's nighttime. I don't know where time went. I thought we were finally becoming friends. I'm trying to live moment to moment but for now the days still blend together. What is supposed to be rest turns into nightmare. All the thoughts you were running away from during the day catch up to you - when you're most vulnerable. No more mansion to hide in, you drift mindlessly in the void. You notice they're not orbiting as close as they once used to. You hold onto that thought until you can&rsquo;t feel.</p>
<p style="-qt-paragraph-type: empty; -qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;" align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="-qt-block-indent: 0; text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;" align="justify">Starting a new day isn't as daunting as it used to be; my lows aren't as hopeless, and my highs are more controlled. I&rsquo;m getting better at taking care of myself. I don't laugh away my problems - because everything is not fine, not now at least. I&rsquo;ll get out of this limbo and it better be the juiciest carrot on earth.</p>
